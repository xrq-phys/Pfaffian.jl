Pfaffian with Parlett-Reid Method
========

This is a simple [Julia](https://julialang.org) program for computing Pfaffian of an antisymmetric matrix.

## WIP List

- ~~Blocked rank-2 update `r2k!`~~
- ~~Accumulate and use blocked version in Parlett-Reid~~
- ~~**Pivoting**~~
- Make `r2k!` more compatible as a julia BLAS-type function
- Improve `r2k!` kernel performance
